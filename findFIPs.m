%function FIPs = findFIPs(FIPCandidates)
%
%Function that will take in all the possible FIP locations and return only
%three locations to the "real" FIPs. Will return an empty matrix if the FIP
%candidates is smaller than 3, something gone wrong then in searching for
%the FIPs. Will return the FIPs in know order, so the output is 
%FIPs = [lowerLeft; topLeft; topRight].
